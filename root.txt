The above line is added before every path in the game.
You must have a "root.txt" file that gives the location of your Text Based Engine root directory if you run the application from a different area.

For example:
If your root is "/stuff/text_based_engine" but you run from "/stuff/compiled_apps/text_based_engine" then
you must have a "root.txt" file within that directory and its first line must be "/stuff/text_based_engine/" or "../../text_based_engine/".
